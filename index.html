					<h6 class="section-title mb-3">Secondary Mission</h6>

					<p><strong>Gas Detection:</strong> We aim to measure specific gases present in the atmosphere using a gas sensor. This will allow us to detect and quantify the presence of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and pollutants, providing valuable information for environmental analysis.</p>

					<p><strong>Humidity Analysis:</strong> To further understand weather patterns and atmospheric stability, we have included a humidity sensor in our CanSat. This sensor will measure and analyze the moisture content in the atmosphere, which influences cloud formation, precipitation, and overall atmospheric conditions.</p>

					<p><strong>Visual Documentation:</strong> Two mini cameras have been integrated into our payload to document the CanSat's descent and gather additional insights. The captured video footage will provide a unique perspective of the environment and aid in post-mission analysis.</p>

					<p><strong>Origami Deploying Solar Array:</strong> Inspired by BYU's collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we have implemented an origami deploying solar array. This solar array will generate and measure electricity during the mission, ensuring a sustainable power source.</p>

					<p><strong>AI-Powered Analysis:</strong> To optimize the analysis of the captured video footage, our system incorporates AI technology. By leveraging AI algorithms, we can identify and track various objects of interest, such as land, trees, bodies of water, or specific landmarks, providing valuable insights into the CanSat's surroundings during its descent.</p>

					<p><strong>System Redundancy:</strong> To mimic the internal systems used in modern satellites, we have implemented a dual microcontroller module setup into our project. These redundant systems ensure seamless operation, allowing one module to take over in case of any failures, eliminating downtime. Both operate under a Slave-Master approach and all share access to every module, including the radio transmitter.</p>

					<p><strong>Air Quality Assessment:</strong> Our CanSat will provide an air quality score to assess the overall air quality at different altitudes. This information will aid in understanding...</p>

							<h6 class="card-title">Origami</h6>
							<p>To ensure a sustainable and independent power supply for our CanSat, we have incorporated a solar array into our design. The array consists of 18 cells, 12 (type A) of which are rated at 3V and 22mA, and 6 (type B) of which are rated at 4.2V and 22mA. The dimensions of type A cells are 64mm by 37mm, while type B cells are 84mm by 37mm. These cells are wired in series in groups of 6, with two type A's and one type B in each group. This provides a peak output of 10.2V and 22mA for each group. Finally, the 6 groups are wired in parallel to give a total peak power output of 10.2V and 132mA. The solar array, a crucial element, captures sunlight and transforms it into electricity, powering the CanSat's functions efficiently. This process uses photovoltaic cells to optimise energy capture and ensure constant operational support. Our array will have a total surface area of 470.64cmВІ. </p>
